# Resevator

A technical, test, elixir application.

## Requirements

The application is designed with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) first in mind.

Setup asdf by following the instruction guide [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

After that, install elixir and erlang:

```bash
asdf plugin add elixir
asdf plugin add erlang
asdf install
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `resevator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:resevator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/resevator>.
